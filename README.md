## Is it actually safe to use Password Checkers?

It’s good to be cautious and it’s never a good idea to enter your legitimate credentials into any website you are not confident about. The ones to watch especially are those who ask you to input your credentials.

## So, why is this Password Strength Meter safe?

* The passwords you type never leave your browser and we don’t store them (You can disconnect your internet connection and then try it if you wish)
* All the checking is done on the page you’re on, not on our servers
* You can install and run the app in your local machine.
* We [AfricTivistes](https://github.com/orgs/AfricTivistes/) working to make people more secure online and the last thing we want to see is passwords being transmitted across the internet insecurely.
